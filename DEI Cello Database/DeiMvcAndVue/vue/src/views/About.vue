      <p class="description">Our mission at the Cello Repertoire Initiative is to empower cello teachers by providing a comprehensive, easy-to-navigate database of level-appropriate repertoire specifically designed for their students. In our commitment to fostering inclusivity and diversity within the world of classical music, we prioritize the promotion of works by composers who have been historically marginalized due to factors such as race, gender, neurodiversity, or socio-economic status. By championing these underrepresented voices, we aim to enrich the cello teaching experience and broaden the musical horizons of both teachers and students alike.</p>
